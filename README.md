# Linked-List

Linked list- linear data structure, with multiple blocks of memory linked to each other.
Array - single block of memory with partitions  .

Limitations in Array:
1. Fixed size
2. Contiguous memory allocation.
3. Insertion or deletion is costly.

Properties of LinkedList:
1. Size can be modified.
2. Non-Contiguous memory.
3. Insertion or deletion at any point is easier.

Node --> contains (Data,address/pointer)
data--> can be of any data-type like int,float,double,char.
pointer --> stores the address of the next node.
head pointer --> stores the address of the 1st node.

## Circular Linked List
1. It is a Single linked list
2. Last node will have the address of the first node
3. Nodes are arranged in circular fashion
